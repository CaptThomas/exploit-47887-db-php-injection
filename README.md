# exploit-47787-db-php-injection
First off go ahead and download just the python file here. 
You can do this by clicking the raw button then double clicking on the text and pressting CTRL + a.
Go and nano this or use some other tool to create a python file in your working directory.
In these instructions, I'll leave it as 47887.py.
Paste in all the code, save, and exit.
Go and find some poor server that uses Book Store 1.0 which uses the 2017 version.
If you are advanced, go ahead and clone this project and edit the file to be able to target other vulnerable PHP applications.
The original exploit uses Python3 but feel free to use Python2 as long as you are using this version.
