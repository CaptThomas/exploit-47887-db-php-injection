# exploit-47787-db-php-injection
# Installing
First off go ahead and download just the python file here. 
You can do this by clicking the raw button then double clicking on the text and pressting CTRL + a.
Go and nano this or use some other tool to create a python file in your working directory.
In these instructions, I'll leave it as 47887.py.
Paste in all the code, save, and exit.
Go and find some poor server that uses Book Store 1.0 which uses the 2017 version.
If you are advanced, go ahead and clone this project and edit the file to be able to target other vulnerable PHP applications.
The original exploit uses Python3 but feel free to use Python2 as long as you are using this version.
Python3 hates this version so if you would rather use Python3 instead of Python2 use https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47887 instead unless you would like to die debugging indents and all sorts of input errors.
# Running
Ok good you made it here so you probably know basic copy pasta.
Open up your terminal and run python 47887.py http://{URL}
Replace {URL} with the hostname of the vulnerable target, follow on-screen prompts, and boom; if everything checks out and the target is indeed using the vulnerable version of Book store then it will spawn a shell.
Please always leave http:// in your command or it will mess up. I.E: python 47887.py http://0.0.0.0
# Post-Exploitation
Go look around if the user can execute any commands as sudo and then go ahead and edit sudoers files to give full access or just spawn su bash shell.
If that doesn't work, nmap internally or find some cron job where you can get a root shell or do look something up.
Hope this is helpful, go leave a link in the Disucssions page if you want me to look over an exploit, peace y'all.
